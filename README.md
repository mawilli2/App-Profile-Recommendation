# App-Profile-Recommendation
## Data Analysis in Python via Jupyter Notebook

The goal of this project is to help app developers understand what type of apps are likely to attract more users on Google Play and the App Store. To do this, we'll need to collect and analyze data about mobile apps available on Google Play and the App Store. This project was completed via the Jupyter Notebook using Python.

The data sets used for the analysis are the two csv files in the repository. 
The report, analysis, and further documentation about the dataset can be found in both html and pdf files.
